        <p>
        Design has always been my way of understanding the world.
        </p>
        <p>I began my career in user research, trained in Human–Computer Interaction and psychology, and assumed I’d stay there forever. But over time I grew restless. I wanted to not only study systems, but shape them. I started teaching myself to code and eventually found my way into product design, where thinking, making, and problem-solving coexist.</p>
        <p>Today, my work focuses on designing platform systems that make complex technology legible, scalable, and trustworthy. I’m drawn to problems where structure matters and where the best design is often invisible, felt rather than noticed.</p>
        <p>I believe good design comes from discomfort and curiosity in equal measure. The willingness to unlearn, to rebuild, and to question assumptions has shaped both my career and my leadership style. It’s also why I care deeply about kindness in teams: clarity and rigor don’t require cruelty, and trust is a prerequisite for good work.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I’m a wife and mother of two teenagers. Family life has profoundly shaped how I show up - with patience, empathy, and perspective. The daily practice of listening, adjusting, and choosing kindness carries directly into how I collaborate, mentor, and lead.</p>
        <p>I’m especially excited about this moment in technology. AI is collapsing the distance between idea and execution, and for designers who understand systems, it’s an extraordinary tool - not to replace judgment, but to amplify it. I spend a lot of time experimenting, building, and learning. I'm interested less in speed for its own sake and more in how humans and machines can work together responsibly.</p>
        <p>I’m motivated by work that lasts: thoughtful systems, resilient teams, and products that respect the people who use them.</p>
