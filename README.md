# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and portfolio:  
https://www.lauraleeflores.com

The site highlights a selection of my work as a Staff Product Designer focused on platform and systems design, including case studies that explore system-level decision-making, cross-surface workflows, and designing for scale, clarity, and trust.

## Purpose

This repository exists primarily to support the site itself. The work showcased on the website is the primary artifact; the code here reflects the structure and implementation needed to publish and maintain it.

## About the implementation

- Built with modern web tooling (Next.js with static generation, component-based content)
- Content-first structure to support long-form case studies
- Designed for clarity, durability, and ease of iteration rather than novelty

While I’m not a software engineer, I’m comfortable working close to code and collaborating on implementation details where it helps clarify system behavior or design intent.

## More about my work

- Portfolio & case studies: https://www.lauraleeflores.com
- Background: Platform and systems design, developer and enterprise tooling, infrastructure-adjacent products

This repository is intentionally minimal and focused. Most of the design thinking lives in the case studies themselves.
