> The quiet center of everything I do.

This site is my digital monograph, a place to share the full story behind my work, my values, and the thread that connects it all. Unlike my [portfolio](https://lauralee.design) or [creative playground](https://lauralee.space), this space is built for stillness and clarity. It‚Äôs not designed to impress, it‚Äôs designed to resonate.

- **lauraleeflores.com** is the narrative core, the context that gives meaning to all my other work.  
- Built with intentional minimalism and a focus on elegant typography, refined spacing, and narrative flow.  
- Serves as a personal compass, pointing outward to my other sites while grounding visitors in who I am.

### ‚ú® Design Philosophy

The interface disappears so the story can speak.

- Ultra-minimal and editorial, inspired by quiet print design  
- Warm serif headlines and soft color palette (`#FAF8F6`, `#2D2A26`, `#D6CCC2`)  
- Subtle, imperceptible motion to create grace, not distraction

This repository contains the code behind the experience, but the intention is human, this site is where I get to be whole.
